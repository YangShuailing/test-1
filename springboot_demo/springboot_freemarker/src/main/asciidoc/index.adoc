= create API document with Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

.request
include::{snippets}/home/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/home/http-response.adoc[]

In this silly demo, all we need to create a API doc is:
- some UT;
- config in the pom.xml;
- one more this index.adoc file
